DiscordTel will collect these info below. By inviting DiscordTel, you grant us permission on collecting these data. You also grant [members of the support server](https://discord.gg/RN7pxrB) the permission to audit some of the said data (Marked with \*) in #bot-log of the aforementioned server, which is a public channel. Some info can be hidden if the number is subscribed to [DiscordTel VIP](./VIP-Number).

- User details (ID, username, discriminator), for storage, basic functioning and debug\*
- Guild details (ID, channel ID), for number registry\* and join/leave log\*
- Messages when calling, for performing calls
- Commands, for debugging (Daily\*, lottery\*, Discoin\*, Calls (can be hidden with VIP)\*)

The last two types of data are also logged locally on the server. Should a certain day's log contain data that relates to you, you can request deletion by emailing `discordtel@austinhuang.me`.

In addition, should you have a number in your server, any @Customer Support can summon an invite and join your server whenever we deem necessary. If you believe such action is not justified, please email `discordtel@austinhuang.me`. It will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

The data is stored on a server owned by SunburntRock89#6617.
