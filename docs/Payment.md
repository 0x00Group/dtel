# How do I keep my number running?

## Earn some balance
### Transfer from Discoin system
Credits earned from [Discoin](http://discoin.sidetrip.xyz)-participating bots can be transferred to DiscordTel. See [here](https://discoin.gitbooks.io/docs/users-guide.html) for commands and more details. DiscordTel's currency code is `DTS`.

### Daily
You can type `>daily` every day to get 120 credits.

### Lottery!
You can type `>lottery <Number of entries>` to enter the lottery. The draw is at EDT/EST 00:00 AM everyday. Each entry cost 5 credits and the money goes into the jackpot.

### Checking your balance
You can use `>balance` in any channel, even the channel doesn't have DTel service enabled. The server must have DTel added, though.

### I'm a developer and I want DiscordTel to accept payments from my bot!
