# VIP Number

DiscordTel's VIP plan works with so called 'VIP Months'. By using `>upgrade` you can transfer the VIP Months from your account to a number.

Please note: benefits and price are subject to changes. These will be announced in our [server][guildInvite].

## Current rate
3 US Dollars or 3 Euros or 4 Canadian Dollars = 1 VIP month.

You can donate to one of the three maintainers:

* Austin (Bus): [https://austinhuang.me/donate](https://austinhuang.me/donate) (PayPal `austinhuang0131@gmail.com`) CAD preferred
* Mitchell: [https://www.paypal.me/mdrademaker](https://www.paypal.me/mdrademaker) (PayPal `mdrademaker19@gmail.com`) EUR preferred
* Rhys (Sun): PayPal `rhys0710@live.com`

Please include your username + discriminator. If you forgot to do so, a copy of the email receipt is required for redemption. Note:

* Must be purchased in increments of whole months.
* PayPal fees, if applicable, are deducted from the donation.
* Cryptocurrencies are accepted, see [here](https://austinhuang.me/donate) (bottom of page). USD value **at reception** will be considered.
* Other payment methods (Robux, gift cards, etc.) other than card/PayPal are available at a case-by-case basis. Please call `*611`.
* Credits are no longer sold.


## Benefits

*	**Disable number recognition**<br/>
	With a VIP number you have the ability to disable your number recognition.
	This means that the other side will be unable to see your number and usernames.
	Details (**Note:** not all) will also be hidden from our public logs.<br/><br/>
*	**Custom name**<br/>
	You may set a custom name for your number.
	This name will show up besides your number (or instead of with number recognition disabled) when calling.<br/><br/>
*	**VIP Emote**<br/>
	Your messages will display the VIP emote, instead of the default one.<br/><br/>
*	**Changing your number**<br/>
	When requesting a number change (by dialing `*611`) won't get rid of all your messages, contacts, phonebook settings, vip settings, etc.<br/><br/>
*	**Number expiry**<br/>
	If your number would expire before the end of your VIP expiry, it will be extended to the same date as your VIP.

## Options
You can find your newly enabled VIP options in the `*411` menu.<br/>
_Note that only someone with the Manage Server permission can access these options_
