# Translations
DiscordTel should be accessible for everyone wanting to use it.  
Therefore we are working on full translations.

## We need your help
Without the help of our community (you) we can't make these translations happen.  
You can start translating by visiting our [gitlocalize][gitlocalize] page.

See the badges below for the current progress.  
If you want to request a different language, join our [support server][serverlink] and ask Bus or Mitchell to add it.

## Translating guide
* Commands:  
  For now, please just fill in the 'usage' property as-is, since it will always pick the English version.  
  You should however translate both the name and description (if applicable).
* Other:  
  As commands are currently not translated, please keep references to commands in English.
