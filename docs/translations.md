**NOTE: translations are currently being used in our beta-version. All progress may be lost/altered later on.**

# Translations
DTel should be accessible for everyone wanting to use it. 
Therefore we are working on full translations.

## We need your help
Without the help of our community (you) we can't make these translations happen. 
You can start translating by visiting our [Git Localize][Git Localize] page (read the guide below first).

See the badges below for the current progress. 
If you want to request a different language, join our [Support Server][Support Server] and ask Bus or Mitchell to add it.

## Translating guide
* Commands:  
  For now, please just fill in the 'usage' property as-is, since it will always pick the English version.
  You should however translate both the name and description (if applicable).
* Other:  
  As commands are currently not translated, please keep references to commands in English.
