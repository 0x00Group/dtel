You can find information on how to donate [here](/docs/Donate)

##	Benefits

*	**Disable number recognition**

	With a VIP number you have the ability to disable your number recognition.
	This means that the other side will be unable to see your number and usernames.
	Details (**Note:** not all) will also be hidden from our public logs.

*	**Custom name**

	You may set a custom name for your number.
	This name will show up besides your number (or instead of with number recognition disabled) when calling.
	
*	**VIP Emote**

	Your messages will display the VIP emote, instead of the default one.
	
*	**Changing your number**

	When requesting a number change (by dialing `*611`) won't get rid of all your messages, contacts, phonebook settings, vip settings, etc.

*	**Number expiry**

	If your number would expire before the end of your VIP expiry, it will be extended to the same date as your VIP.
