Please note: benefits and price are subject to changes. These will be announced in our [server][guildInvite].

## Current rate

You can find information on how to donate [here][paymentLink]

##	Benefits

*	**Disable number recognition**<br/>
	With a VIP number you have the ability to disable your number recognition.
	This means that the other side will be unable to see your number and usernames.
	Details (**Note:** not all) will also be hidden from our public logs.<br/><br/>
*	**Custom name**<br/>
	You may set a custom name for your number.
	This name will show up besides your number (or instead of with number recognition disabled) when calling.<br/><br/>
*	**VIP Emote**<br/>
	Your messages will display the VIP emote, instead of the default one.<br/><br/>
*	**Changing your number**<br/>
	When requesting a number change (by dialing `*611`) won't get rid of all your messages, contacts, phonebook settings, vip settings, etc.<br/><br/>
*	**Number expiry**<br/>
	If your number would expire before the end of your VIP expiry, it will be extended to the same date as your VIP.
