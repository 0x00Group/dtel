Wow! How nice to you! I accept several ways to donate:

# Using real money
**WARNING:** Please do not pay me in Patreon (Even though I have a Patreon page). I will not be able to receive your money.

## Credit/Debit card
You can buy credits...

* [here](http://mtl0131.bigcartel.com), if your card can pay in Canadian dollars. $1.33 CAD per 1 million credits.
* or [here](https://selly.gg/p/e14c86fc), if your card can pay in US dollars. $1.24 USD per 1 million credits. Automatic delivery.

**Note:**

1. For the Canadian one, the "shipping" cost is the [Stripe processing fee](https://stripe.com/ca/pricing).
2. NO PAYPAL. Perfect Money/Credit/Debit/Prepaid accepted. *Or, if you know where I live, a POS terminal will be available on spot. But I suspect no one knows where I live. Hehehehe.*

## [Interac E-Transfer](http://interac.ca/en/interac-e-transfer-consumer.html) (For Canadians only)
Send your money to `austinhuang0131@gmail.com`. Don't forget to DM austinhuang#1076 the secret question and response!

## Bitcoins / Litecoin / Ethereum
[Here](https://selly.gg/p/e14c86fc).

If you have Coinbase, you can avoid that high transaction fee! Read [this article](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/971437) for details (`austinhuang0131@icloud.com`).

# Using non-money credits

## Robux
Roblox only allow group payouts as a method of transferring Robux for Non-BC users, so:

1. You need BC. You can also ask someone that has BC to perform the action on your behalf.
2. Create a group if you don't own a group.
3. Create a group T-shirt and buy it if you don't have funds in your group.
4. Give austinhuang#1076 the group URL so we can join your group and receive the Robux.
5. Once joined, send your Robux to austinhuang0131.

## Gift cards
We accept any digital gift card with a code to be used online. We also accept Steam game keys. Please contact austinhuang#1076 for details.
