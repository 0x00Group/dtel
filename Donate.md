Send your money to `austinhuang0131@gmail.com`. Don't forget to DM austinhuang#1076 the secret question and response!

## SEPA Debit (In Euros. Europeans only)
Available on request.

No one has ever tried this before. Don't send more than 5 euros. (I’m not entirely sure if my SEPA is subject to a 5-euro fee.) so that if it gets stuck it might refund you. Anyways, if I never received the money but you showed me evidence that you paid it (Less than 5 euros), you will get the credits, but I will also disable the method later on.

## Manually pay in PayPal
![](https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/mktg/logo/bdg_now_accepting_pp_2line_w.png)

[Here](http://paypal.me/discordtel). Please write your name and the item you want in details. If you’re paying with a card, transaction fees will be deducted from total credits.

## Manually pay in Bitcoins / Litecoin / Ethereum

If you have Coinbase, you can avoid that high transaction fee! Read [this article](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/971437) for details (`austinhuang0131@icloud.com`).

## WeChat Pay (Mainly for Chinese)
Not actually WeChat Pay, but anyways...Add `austinhuangcenter` as a friend (Should have a bus avatar) and write your Discord username as friend request. Then, send a **transfer**. (**DON'T SEND ME A RED PACKET.** I hate guessing how much you have.)

# Using non-money credits

## Robux
Roblox only allow group payouts as a method of transferring Robux for Non-BC users, so:

1. You need BC. You can also ask someone that has BC to perform the action on your behalf.
2. Create a group if you don't own a group.
3. Create a group T-shirt and buy it if you don't have funds in your group.
4. Give austinhuang#1076 the group URL so we can join your group and receive the Robux.
5. Once joined, send your Robux to austinhuang0131.

## Gift cards
We accept any digital gift card with a code to be used online (PaySafeCard, Steam, etc.). We also accept Steam game keys. Please contact austinhuang#1076 for details.
