# Using non-money credits

## Robux
Roblox only allow group payouts as a method of transferring Robux for Non-BC users, so:

1. You need BC. You can also ask someone that has BC to perform the action on your behalf.
2. Create a group if you don't own a group.
3. Create a group T-shirt and buy it if you don't have funds in your group.
4. Give austinhuang#1076 the group URL so we can join your group and receive the Robux.
5. Once joined, send your Robux to austinhuang0131.

## Gift cards
We accept any digital gift card with a code to be used online. We also accept Steam game keys. Please contact austinhuang#1076 for details.
