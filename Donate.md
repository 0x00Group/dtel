Wow! How nice to you! I accept several ways to donate:

**NO REFUND**

# Using real money
**WARNING:** Please do not pay me in Patreon (Even though I have a Patreon page). I will not be able to receive your money.

**NOW ACCEPTS PAYPAL!**

## Automatic Delivery
You can buy credits...

* [here](https://selly.gg/p/a600107c), if you can pay in Canadian dollars. $1.33 CAD per 1 million credits. Accept credit/debit/prepaid cards (Choose Stripe as payment method), PayPal, Bitcoins, Litecoins, and Ethereums.
* or [here](https://selly.gg/p/e14c86fc), if your card can pay in US dollars. $1.2 USD per 1 million credits. In addition to methods above, you can pay in [Perfect Money](http://perfectmoney.is).

...and receive them automatically.

**Note:** [Stripe processing fee](https://stripe.com/ca/pricing)/[PayPal processing fee](https://www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees) is included in total price. In case of increase/decrease of fees, they will be deducted from/added to total credits once I see it.

## [Interac E-Transfer](http://interac.ca/en/interac-e-transfer-consumer.html) (For Canadians only)
Send your money to `austinhuang0131@gmail.com`. Don't forget to DM austinhuang#1076 the secret question and response!

## SEPA Debit (In Euros. Europeans only)
* Bank Name: `Mistertango` (In Lithuania. Don’t ask me how I have an account in a random European country.)
* Bank Address: `Perkūnkiemio 2`
* Bank Address City: `Vilnius`
* BIC: `MIEGLT21`
* DM me for recipient name
* Number: `LT93 3510 0000 2542 5673`

No one has ever tried this before. Don't send more than 5 euros (I’m not entirely sure if SEPA is subject to a 5-euro fee.) so that if it gets stuck it might refund you. Anyways, if I never received the money but you showed me evidence that you paid it (Less than 5 euros), you will get the credits, but I will also disable the method later on.

## Manually pay in PayPal
[Here](http://paypal.me/discordtel). Please write your name and the item you want in details. If you’re paying with a card, transaction fees will be deducted from total credits.

## Manually pay in Bitcoins / Litecoin / Ethereum

If you have Coinbase, you can avoid that high transaction fee! Read [this article](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/971437) for details (`austinhuang0131@icloud.com`).

# Using non-money credits

## Robux
Roblox only allow group payouts as a method of transferring Robux for Non-BC users, so:

1. You need BC. You can also ask someone that has BC to perform the action on your behalf.
2. Create a group if you don't own a group.
3. Create a group T-shirt and buy it if you don't have funds in your group.
4. Give austinhuang#1076 the group URL so we can join your group and receive the Robux.
5. Once joined, send your Robux to austinhuang0131.

## Gift cards
We accept any digital gift card with a code to be used online. We also accept Steam game keys. Please contact austinhuang#1076 for details.
