# Welcome to DiscordTel!
This guide will assist newcomers in setting up DTel for their server!

## 1. Inviting the bot => Choosing its channel
Click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=224662505157427200&scope=bot&permissions=84997) to add the bot to your server, then choose/create a channel to register your number in.

## 2. Choosing a number
The current normal prefix is `0301` for a channel number or `0900` for a mobile number. Before proceeding, please decide your preferred number.

Numbers are 11-digits. e.g. `0301XXXXXXX`. If you want to have a word number (e.g. 0301-LETTERS), you can use [this tool](http://word2number.com).

You can get a number with the prefix `0900`. This is a mobile prefix. They can have the same digits as `0301` numbers.

Discord servers with 100+ members that provide a service may be eligible for `0800`/`0844` prefixes. Contact austinhuang in the support server.

## 3. Running the wizard
`>wizard`

Run this command in the channel you chose earlier.

The bot will send a message like this (will be similar, not the same):

If you want a mobile number (prefix `0900`), run `>wizard` in a DM (Direct Message) with the DTel bot.

The wizard is only available to register `0301` and `0900` numbers. For all other numbers, please refer to calling Customer Support: `>pdial *611`.

## 4. Confirmation
Congratulations! You set up your number.
The bot should send a message like this:

Read the [Payment](http://discordtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Payment/) section for information about how to extend your number.
