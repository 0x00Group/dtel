# Welcome to DiscordTel!
Here's a quick and easy crash course to DiscordTel!

## 1. Invite the bot => choose a channel
Click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=224662505157427200&scope=bot&permissions=84997) to add the bot to your server, then choose a channel to register your number in.

## 2. Choose a number
The current normal prefix is `0301`. Before proceeding please think about your preferred number.

Numbers are 11-digit. e.g. `0301XXXXXXX`. You can use [this tool](http://word2number.com) to help you get a number.

You can get a number with the prefix `0900`. This is a mobile prefix. They can have the same digits as `0301` numbers.

Discords with 100+ members that provide a service might be eligible for `0800`/`0844` prefixes. Contact austinhuang in the support server.

## 3. Run the wizard
`>wizard`

Run the command in your channel you chose earlier.

If you want a mobile number (prefix `0900`), run `>wizard` in a DM (Direct Message) with the bot.

The wizard is only available to register `0301` and `0900` numbers. For all other numbers, `>pdial *611`.

## 4. Wait for your congratulation
You setup your number!! YAY!!!
It should popup with a message like this: (note it may not be **exactly** the same message)
![DMnumbermessage]()

Read the [payment](http://discordtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Payment/) section for information about how to extend your number.
