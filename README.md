DiscordTel **is** a Discord Telephone Bot that you can add to your server, *setup* a number, and dial **other** Discord servers with the bot.

It acts *like* a telephone network, **but** you **can't** make **real-world calls**. Sorry.

Aside from the *bitter* disappointment of no VoIP calls, we even have a **611** number to dial if you have any problems with DiscordTel, any questions, or something's happening in your server.

Real Customer Support people *answer* your calls. We're **always** there.

So, ready to *dive* into a world of DiscordTel?

**Come** join us! Read the documentation we have here:
