# DiscordTel 4.0 BETA [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Support_Server-7289DA.svg)](https://discord.gg/RN7pxrB) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/discordtel/badge/?version=latest)](http://discordtel.austinhuang.me/en/latest/)

DiscordTel is a bot for Discord that allows you to set up a custom number and call other Discord servers.

The bot acts like a telephone network, but **cannot** make real-world calls. Sorry people.

You can >dial `*611` if you have any problems or questions about the bot, or if there is a problem within your server that involves trollers/spammers.

So, ready to *dive* into the world of DiscordTel?
