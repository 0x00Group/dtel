# DTel 4.0 BETA [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Support_Server-7289DA.svg)](https://discord.gg/RN7pxrB) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/dtel/badge/?version=latest)](http://dtel.austinhuang.me/en/latest/)

DTel is a bot for Discord that allows you to set up a custom number and call other Discord servers.

The bot acts like a telephone network, but **cannot** make real-world calls. Sorry people.

If you have any questions or probelms with the bot, or if someone is trolling/spamming your number, you can >dial `*611`.

So, ready to *dive* into the world of DTel?
