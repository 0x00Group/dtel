# Emergency Call

In early March 2017, Silicon Valley requested a removal of the 911 number so we're no longer able to route your call to [Discord Bans](http://bans.discordlist.net) itself. However, you can still dial `*611` for help in these situations:

* There is no staff available in the raided/spammed server and you'd like them to be banned, or
* You'd like to submit a report **before** they are banned (Please only do that if the raid has ended).

*Note: A raid means spamming using organized groups or userbots. [Read this Gizmodo article](http://gizmodo.com/how-a-video-game-chat-client-became-the-web-s-new-cessp-1792039566) for details.*

You are required to provide a permanent invite. Troll calls will result in termination of service as well as blacklisted.
