# Welcome to DiscordTel!
Did you just add DiscordTel to your server? Great! Want a number? Sure, just follow these steps...

## 1. Choose a channel
So we can know which channel you want to enable the DTel service.

## 2. Choose a number
The current normal prefix is `0301`. Before proceeding please think about your preferred number.

Numbers are 11-digit. e.g. `0301XXXXXXX`. You can use [this tool](http://word2number.com) to help you get a number.

If you are special enough you might be eligible for `0800`/`0844` prefixes. Contact austinhuang in the support server.

## 3. Call *611 using a payphone
Just type `>pdial *611`. `*611` is a free dial.

If no one picks up your call, maybe try again. We know it's a problem, but we're just starting and we don't want to hire *too many* operators. Sorry.

## 4. Wait for your congratulation
YOU DID IT!!! YAY!!!

Read the [payment](http://discordtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Payment/) section for information about how to extend your number.
