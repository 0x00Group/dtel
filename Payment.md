# Win credit rewards!
Every random amount of time, ranging from 5 to 15 minutes, the bot will give out a random amount of credits, ranging from 8 to 200 credits, in the #general channel of [DiscordTel HQ](https://discord.gg/RN7pxrB). If a user runs the `>claim` command in 30 seconds, he/she will receive the award. These are tax-free credits which means you can use 100% of them without wasting any tax.

# Paying for your number or your payphone credit

## 0. Payment bots we recognize

| Bot Name                                         | Tax Rate |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| [Tatsumaki](http://tatsumaki.xyz)                | 20%      |
| [Mantaro](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot) | 40%      |
| [Hifumi](http://hifumibot.xyz/)                  | 50%      |

*Side note: Tatsumaki's 20% tax exists on its side ("Amount due after tax" as you see), whereas Mantaro's 40% tax and Hifumi's 50% tax exists on our side.*

### I'm a developer and I want DiscordTel to accept payments from my bot!
1. Your bot has to be in over 1000 servers.
2. Your bot must DM DiscordTel when a transaction to DiscordTel is performed, and the DM **must** include the user's ID and the amount of transaction.
3. Once you qualify and you have contacted austinhuang#1076, we'll figure out the tax rate based on your currency's rarity (how easy it is to get it, how much you'll get for each command, etc).

## 1. Figure out the tax rate

| Usage                         | Pay by Tatsu | Pay by Mantano | Pay by Hifumi | We get |
|-------------------------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Renew your number for 1 month | 2500         | 3333           | 3000          | 2000   |
| 1 message sent using payphone | 10           | 14             | 12            | 8      |

## 2. Earn money

For every certified bot, read its documentation to learn how to earn money.

## 3. Top-Up
In any server with both the bot and DiscordTel: Make sure both bots are online, then:

* `t!credit @DiscordTel <Amount>` for Tatsumaki
* `~>transfer @DiscordTel <Amount>` for Mantaro
* `~transfer <Amount> @DiscordTel` for Hifumi

Your `<Amount>` is the price *paid by respective bot* according to the table above. After that you'll receive a confirmation.

**WARNING: DO NOT TOP-UP WHEN DISCORDTEL IS OFFLINE!!!**

Type `>help` before transactions to see if DiscordTel is online or not. If you did not receive the credits in your DTel account, contact [DiscordTel HQ](https://discord.gg/RN7pxrB).

## 4. Check balance
You can `>dial *233` in any channel, even the channel doesn't have DTel service enabled.

## Use your balance
### Renew your number
`>dial *233` in the channel that has DTel service enabled, then type the amount of months you want to renew for.

### Payphone
`>pdial <Number>`.
