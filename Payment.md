# Paying for your number or your payphone credit
You'll need [Tatsumaki](http://tatsumaki.xyz), since we use its credit system. *Because it's more popular.*

## 1. Figure out the tax rate
When you transfer credits using Tatsumaki, it charges 20% tax. So we'll only receive 80% of your payment.

| Usage                         | You pay | We get |
|-------------------------------|---------|--------|
| Renew your number for 1 month | 2500    | 2000   |
| 1 message sent using payphone | 10      | 8      |

## 2. Earn money
Two ways:

* `t!daily` every 24 hours;
* `t!fish`. You need to pay 10 credit for each cast, and then you can earn them back by selling your inventory.
  * `t!fish sell common`
  * `t!fish sell uncommon`
  * `t!fish sell garbage`

## 3. Top-Up
In any server with both Tatsumaki and DiscordTel: Make sure both bots are online, then `t!credit @DiscordTel <Amount>`. Your `<Amount>` is the price *you pay* according to the table above. After that you'll receive a confirmation.

**WARNING: DO NOT TOP-UP WHEN DISCORDTEL IS OFFLINE!!!**

## 4. Check balance
You can `>dial *233` in any channel, even the channel doesn't have DTel service enabled.

## Use your balance
### Renew your number
`>dial *233` in the channel that has DTel service enabled, then type the amount of months you want to renew for.

### Payphone
`>pdial <Number>`.
